# Asteroid Predictive Analysis and Modeling

## Objective
This dataset comes from NASA’s NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service), a RESTful web service that details asteroid information near Earth. I'm going to be using this data to understand:
1. what features are most correlated with an asteroid being classified as hazardous or not
2. Finding the best classification model to accurately predict whether an asteroid is hazardous or not

## Business Problem
This analysis would be great for NASA and the aerospace and space exploration industry to use for planetary defense and risk management.
Resource Allocation: Space organizations often have limited resources for monitoring and researching asteroids. This model could help prioritize which asteroids need the most immediate attention or study, allowing organizations to allocate resources more efficiently.
Partnerships and Funding: This project could also be used to pitch for funding or collaborations with other organizations who are interested in asteroid risk management. Governments and other organizations could also use this project as a tool to provide transparent data about asteroids for monitoring or emergency preparedness plans.
Public awareness: This project could be used to educate the masses on asteroids and could become an open-source tool for people to do their own research with. 

## Data Understanding
This dataset contains 4687 rows and has 40 features to describe asteroids. There were no null values to clean, but feature engineering and feature selection techniques were used to make the data more relevant for analysis and modeling.
